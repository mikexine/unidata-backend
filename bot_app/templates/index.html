<h1>UniOpen</h1>
<p>The aim of this project is to collect data from various universities - starting with the Italian ones - elaborate this data and make them available to anyone, in a simple JSON format.</p>
<p>You can find the docs of the available API calls <a href="docs">here.</a></p>
<br />
<p>UniOpen is a member of <a href="http://uniorganization.org/" target="_blank">UniOrganization</a>, check the link for more details!</p>

<p>These projects are using UniOpen.org:</p>
<li><p><a href="http://bot.UniOpen.org" target="_blank"><strong>UnipdBot Chat-Bot</strong></a>, a simple bot that can send data about the University of Padua. Available on <a href="https://telegram.me/unipdbot">Telegram</a> and <a href="https://m.me/unipdbot">Facebook Messenger</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://uniwhere.co" target="_blank"><strong>Uniwhere</strong></a> is an app that takes the entire experience of university and makes it mobile: students can not only access their academic careers, exams, tests, results on their smartphones automatically; they can talk with each other using exam-based group chats, exchange materials or hints and use a peer-to-peer based weekly schedule of lessons.</p></li>

<h4 align="center">Want to help?</h4>
<p>Help is very much appreciated, both with the data collection and with the code. Most of the data are static (libraries, study rooms) but some data are scraped daily from different websites (to get the current day's menu, for example).</p>
